##All wrapped up!

Price of Entry is officially done!

We are happy to announce we have officially completed our first radio documentary. After all the hours of interviewing, transcribing, and editing, it feels very good to be able to share it with the world.

##Some of the challenges…
Although this documentary was mostly smooth sailing, we did encounter a few challenges. Timing was one of them, because although we had planned everything in advanced, you can never have enough time to edit.

Another difficulty we had to face was when we lost one of our voices for the documentary. Originally we had an extra voice from another refugee who also had a very powerful story. However, due to the sensitivity of the topic of our documentary, he felt overwhelmed and decided to step away from the spotlight. At the beginning it was difficult to adapt without his voice, but afterwards we still found a way to convey a powerful message from their stories.

##Rolling with the punches
So our challenges really turned into a blessing. The other character we had in mind originally would have been great, but the characters we have were fantastic sharing their stories.

And our tight schedule for editing also forced us to make decisions and move on to the next thing. Not allowing us to second guess our choices.
This process really showed us both that there is always a way. Just because one thing doesn’t work out, it doesn’t mean it’s the end of the world. To be a good journalist you have to learn to roll with the punches, otherwise a lot of great stories would be abandoned. This is a great lesson that we are both happy to have learned early on in our journalism career.

##What’s next?
The only thing that is left to do with this project is to wait for a response. We may shop around for scholarship contests to submit it to, but other than that, it’s on to the next one. In fact we are each currently working on new radio documentaries already! So, this won’t be the last to hear from us.
Our hope is that this documentary helps others who are also struggling to adapt to their new lives, and that the message reaches far beyond immigrant families. We would like for this documentary to open up the conversation about immigration and the supporting programs available to new families.

##Thank you
Thank you for tuning in and keeping up with our progress. This topic really grew close to our hearts throughout this process. It’s an exciting thing to be able to say “I produced something that could make a difference.” We will both be chasing that feeling of excitement and fulfillment again with our next projects moving forward.
We would also like to thank Visnja and Wonderful for sharing their stories with us. We feel very honored to have had the privilege of talking to them and being able to tell their stories.

#Background

Thousands of immigrants come to Canada every year, yet not many programs are in place to help them successfully transition to their new lives. Unfortunately, young immigrants feel the most pressure when they are forced to become the bilingual bridge between their home and the outside world, realizing that safe, may not necessarily mean peaceful. 

Wonderful Wonderful came to Canada with his family when he was 13-years-old. His family was forced to flee his village in Burma, and had to live in a refugee camp for 10 years before they were able to come to Canada. 

Visnja Milidragovic came to Canada with her family in 1994. Her family had to leave their home in former Yugoslavia after the war broke out and decided to come to Canada. Visnja was six when they first arrived to Vancouver. 

Both Visnja and Wonderful wanted to share their stories through this documentary, to help shed light on some of the pressures young immigrants face when they come to Canada. Many end up having to worry about their new lives, as well as their parents’ needs.

An average of 250,000 immigrants come to Canada every year. Even though Canada provided a safer living environment, many face incredible difficulties adapting to their new lives. Several of those challenges are a product of poor language proficiency. Such is the case with Visjna, Wonderful, and their families. 

Below is a map that displays the top 10 countries of origin of refugee claimants coming to Canada in 2012. The map showcases the diversity of those who come to Canada.

In order for people to have an easier transition to their new lives, it is vital to pay attention to the programs that are available to them to help them adapt to a foreign county. Even the simplest of tasks can become overwhelming when there is no method to relate or communicate.

Last summer the federal government announced it was pulling funding for English as a Second Language programs affecting 17 institutions across B.C. The $17 million dollar cut is expected to affect an average of 9,000 students per year.

The ESL classes were offered for free to Canadian citizens who wished to continue their education or work in Canada. Funding for these classes is one of the examples a vital program offered to immigrants that will no longer be available. 

Language playing a huge role in how immigrants adapt to their lives in Canada, the more support they can get, the better it usually is for them and their families. 
 
Lisa Robertson, an ESL Instructor at Camosun College explains, “A number of institutions proposed to the federal government for funding for English for academic purposes, English for access and English for work, and those are the three areas that we have within our articulation framework." 

BCIT’s Professional English Language Development program (PELD) was one of the programs affected by the cuts. PELD caters to ESL students who are hoping to get into full-time programs, focusing on both language skills and academic skills. 
 
“It makes it harder for us to run with a reduced government funding overall, there’s no extra money around the institution to make up the shortfall between what we charge in cost recovery and what we will be charging now.”
 
Mathews says the school may have to look into the possibility of larger class sizes to make up for funding changes and to meet the new student demand.
 
In the mean time, it means students will continue to be turned down as waitlists continue to quickly reach capacity.
