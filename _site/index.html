                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>In Limbo focuses on a 24-year old Vancouver woman from an
                affluent family who lives with depression,
                bipolar disorder, and severe anxiety. She is the one in five
                people who experience significant mental health problems in B.C.</p>

                <p>Living with depression and bipolar disorder is very difficult, Ashley has
                had to deal with depression her whole life and when it gets too difficult,
                her only option is a trip to the ER to prevent her from hurting herself.</p>

                <p>However Ashley explains she’s often felt in limbo when it comes
                to her health, as she explains she is not “sick enough” to
                be considered a danger to herself or others; yet, she is
                not healthy enough to be able to lead a “normal” life and
                finish school or hold a steady job.</p>

                <p>Her journey has taken her into the world of drugs, where she sometimes finds peace.
                Despite having experience first-hand the risks of consuming drugs,
                she would rather find happiness while high that sometimes having
                to deal with reality and her depression.</p>

                <p>Mental health has been an issue on the rise across Canada.
                Recent statistics suggest one in five Canadians suffer from
                 mental health issues. The cost of ignoring mental health problems
                 affects everyone; according to a report B.C. spent over $1.3
                 billion dollars on mental health. St. Paul’s hospital alone
                 has seen an increase of over 43% of hospital visits related
                 to mental issues.</p>

                <p>Through this documentary we are hoping to
                find out if the government is doing enough to help those
                individuals with these invisible yet debilitating diseases.</p>

                    <hr class="divider">
                    <p>After obtaining her B.A. in Political Science, Estefania Duran
                      went on to study at the London School of journalism.
                      Her experience at LSJ and her passion to approach information in a
                      critical manner, led her to the Broadcast and Online journalism Program
                       at BCIT. When she is not running around looking for her next story,
                       you can find Estefania on her yoga mat or baking her stress away. </p>

                    <h3>Olivia Smith</h3>
                    <hr class="divider">
                    <p>Olivia went to Simon Fraser University for four years where she studied
                      Communications, Art, and Technology.
                      The classes that interested her the most were her journalism and
                      TV/Film classes, prompting her to attend
                      the Broadcast Journalism program at BCIT. Since then, Olivia
                      has found a great passion in making television.
                      She began interning at Vancouver-based Lark Productions
                      where she learned the ins and outs of reality TV development.
                      But when an opportunity came for her to work in the field for
                      Lark’s own Emergency Room: Life + Death at VGH, she knew she
                      had a found her true calling. She hopes to one day produce
                      award-winning shows in either unscripted or scripted programming
                      but realizes she still has a lot to learn. Either way, she is
                      ready to take on any challenge that comes her way so long as
                      she gets to be creative and inquisitive.</p>
